          13. MISCELLANEOUS.
          <br>
          <br>
          13.1. Entire Agreement; Order of Precedence. These Terms contain the entire agreement,
          and supersede all prior and contemporaneous understandings between the parties regarding
          the Services. These Terms do not alter the terms or conditions of any other electronic
          or written agreement you may have with Company for the Services or for any other
          Company product or service or otherwise. In the event of any conflict between these
          Terms and any other agreement you may have with Company, the terms of that other
          agreement will control only if these Terms are specifically identified and declared
          to be overridden by such other agreement.
          <br>
          <br>
          13.2. Amendment. We reserve the right to make changes or modifications to these
          Terms from time to time, in our sole discretion. Amended Terms will become effective immediately on the date they are posted to the
          Services unless we state otherwise via our notice of such amended Terms. Any amended
          Terms will apply prospectively to use of the Services after such changes become
          effective. Your continued use of the Services following the effective date of such
          changes will constitute your acceptance of such changes. If you do not agree to
          any amended Terms, you must discontinue using the Services.
          <br>
          <br>
          13.3. Waiver. Our failure or delay in exercising any right, power or privilege under
          these Terms will not operate as a waiver thereof.
          <br>
          <br>
          13.4. Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any of these Terms will
          not affect the validity or enforceability of any other of these Terms, all of which
          will remain in full force and effect.
          <br>
          <br>
          13.5. Force Majeure Events. Company will not be liable for any loss or damage
          arising from any event beyond Company’s reasonable control, including, but not
          limited to, flood, extraordinary weather conditions, earthquake, or other act of
